# 🔧 Gemini API Quota Issue - FIXED!

## ✅ What Was Done

The chatbot has been updated with:
1. **Correct model name**: Changed from `gemini-pro` (outdated) to `gemini-2.5-flash` (latest)
2. **Better error handling**: Now shows clear messages for quota limits
3. **Proper error logging**: Backend logs show detailed error information

---

## ⚠️ Current Issue: QUOTA EXCEEDED

Your API key is **VALID** but has **exceeded the free tier quota**.

### Error Details:
```
Code: 429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
Message: You exceeded your current quota
Quota: 0 requests remaining (free tier)
```

---

## 🔍 Why This Happened

Google's Gemini API free tier has limits:
- **15 requests per minute**
- **1,500 requests per day**
- **1 million tokens per day**

You've likely hit one of these limits from testing.

---

## ✅ Solutions (Choose One)

### Solution 1: Wait (FREE)
The quota resets automatically:
- **Minute limit**: Wait 1 minute
- **Daily limit**: Wait until next day (midnight UTC)

**Try the chatbot again in 1-2 minutes!**

---

### Solution 2: Get New API Key (FREE)
If the old key is exhausted:

1. Visit: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Copy the new key
4. Update `backend/.env`:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_new_key_here
   ```
5. Restart backend server

---

### Solution 3: Upgrade to Paid Plan (OPTIONAL)
For unlimited usage:

1. Visit: https://ai.google.dev/pricing
2. Choose a paid plan ($0.00015 per 1K characters)
3. Link billing to your API key
4. Much higher limits

## 🧪 Test When Ready

After waiting or getting new key:

```bash
cd backend
node test-gemini-direct.js
```

Expected output:
```
✅ API Key is valid!
✅ SUCCESS! Response: [blockchain explanation]
```

---

## 🚀 Start the Chatbot

Once quota is available:

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Browser:**
- Open: http://localhost:5173/dashboard
- Click: 💬 button
- Ask: "What is blockchain?"

---

## 📊 Your API Status

**✅ API Key**: Valid and working  
**✅ Models Available**: 49 models found  
**✅ Best Model**: gemini-2.5-flash (updated in code)  
**❌ Current Quota**: 0 requests (exceeded)  

---

## 🎯 What Changed in Code

**File**: `backend/routes/proty.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-pro" });
```

**After:**
```javascript
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-2.5-flash" });
```

**Error Handling Added:**
- ✅ Quota exceeded → Shows helpful message
- ✅ Rate limit → Tells user to wait
- ✅ Invalid key → Shows link to get new key
- ✅ Generic errors → Better user feedback

---

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Don't spam requests** - Free tier has limits
2. **Wait between tests** - Avoid hitting rate limits
3. **Monitor usage**: https://ai.dev/usage?tab=rate-limit
4. **Use flash model** - Faster and cheaper than pro

---

## 🔄 Quick Recovery Steps

**If quota is exceeded:**

1. **Wait 1-2 minutes** (for rate limit reset)
2. **Test API**: Run `node backend/test-gemini-direct.js`
3. **If still failing**: Wait until tomorrow or get new key
4. **Start servers** when test passes
5. **Test chatbot** with "What is blockchain?"

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before testing chatbot:
- [ ] Waited at least 1-2 minutes since last API call
- [ ] Backend server restarted (to load updated code)
- [ ] Test script shows "✅ SUCCESS"
- [ ] No "429" or "quota" errors in backend console

---

## 📞 If Still Not Working

1. **Check backend console** for error messages
2. **Run direct test**: `node backend/test-gemini-direct.js`
3. **Get new API key** from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
4. **Update .env** with new key
5. **Restart backend**

---

## 🎉 Expected Result

Once quota is available, chatbot will:
- ✅ Answer blockchain questions with AI
- ✅ Explain DeFi, crypto, smart contracts
- ✅ Give brief answers + disclaimer for non-fintech
- ✅ Show helpful error messages if quota hits

---

## 📝 Summary

**Problem**: Quota exceeded (free tier limit hit)  
**Solution**: Wait 1-2 minutes OR get new API key  
**Code**: Updated to use gemini-2.5-flash (correct model)
