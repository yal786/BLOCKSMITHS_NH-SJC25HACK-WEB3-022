### 3️⃣ What You Should See

**Modal appears with:**

  - 💰 Estimated Loss: $1.50
  - 🎯 Attacker Profit: $0.60
  - 📉 Slippage: 0.01%
  - 🔗 View Full Simulation on Tenderly

**Actions:**
- Click "🔄 Re-run Simulation" to run again
- Click "Close" to return to dashboard

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

- ✅ **No page redirect** - Modal opens on same page
- ✅ **No blank page** - Everything works in modal
- ✅ **Auto-runs** - No manual "Run" button needed
- ✅ **Beautiful UI** - Dark theme, smooth animations
- ✅ **Complete data** - All fields display correctly

## ⚠️ Expected Issues (Normal!)

### **"Re-simulation failed: 404"**
**Why?** Demo transactions don't exist in Tenderly database

**Solution:** This is normal for demo mode! The modal still works perfectly. In production, use real transaction hashes.

- Manual hash entry required
- Separate page navigation

### **After:**
- Clicking "Re-simulate" → Modal opens → Stays on dashboard ✅
