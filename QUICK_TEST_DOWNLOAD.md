# 🚀 Quick Test - Download Full Report

## Step-by-Step Testing Guide

### ✅ Servers are Running
- **Backend:** Running on `http://localhost:4000` ✅
- **Frontend:** Running on `http://localhost:3000` ✅

---

## 📝 Test Steps

### 1️⃣ Open Browser
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 2️⃣ Navigate to Analytics
Two ways to access:

**Option A: From Dashboard**
- Click any alert card in the left sidebar
- Click the blue **"Analytics"** button on the alert

**Option B: Direct Navigation**
- Look for the Analytics button in the top navigation
- Or wait for alerts to appear and follow Option A

### 3️⃣ Find the Download Button
In the Analytics view, at the **top-right corner**, you'll see:
```
[<- Back to Dashboard]  [📊 Analytics Dashboard]  [📥 Download Full Report]  [View Global Metrics]
```

The **"Download Full Report"** button is:
- **Cyan/turquoise colored**
- Has a download icon (📥)
- Located at the top-right

### 4️⃣ Click and Download
1. Click **"Download Full Report"**
2. Button text changes to **"Generating..."**
3. PDF downloads automatically as `Protego-Full-Report.pdf`
4. Success message appears: "✅ Full report downloaded successfully!"

---

## 🎯 Expected Result

You should get a comprehensive PDF with:
- **Page 1:** Title page + Analytics Summary
- **Page 2+:** Alerts section (up to 20 alerts)
- **Next pages:** Simulations section
- **Next pages:** Protections section
- **Last pages:** Audit logs section

---

## 🔍 Quick Backend Test (Optional)

Test the endpoint directly:

```bash
# In PowerShell or Command Prompt
curl http://localhost:4000/v1/reports/full
```

Should return JSON with all report data.

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/v1/reports/full/pdf --output test-report.pdf
```

Should download the PDF directly.

---

## 💡 What If There's No Data?

The report will still generate but may show:
- Empty sections for alerts, simulations, etc.
- Zero values in analytics summary
- "No data available" messages

**To generate data:**
1. Use the mempool listener (automatically detects transactions)
2. Or manually trigger simulations from the Dashboard
3. Or protect transactions using the Protect button
