# 🎯 Unique Transactions - Quick Start

## ✅ What's Done

Your Protego system now ensures **100% unique transactions** in both alerts and analytics!

### Key Changes:
1. ✅ **Database constraints** added to prevent duplicates
2. ✅ **Smart insert logic** that skips duplicate transactions automatically
3. ✅ **Accurate analytics** - each transaction counted only once
4. ✅ **All tests passed** - implementation verified working

### Test Results:
```
🧪 Testing Unique Transactions Implementation
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ All required unique constraints are in place
✅ No duplicate tx_hashes in alerts table
✅ Duplicate correctly skipped (ON CONFLICT worked)
✅ Database verification passed

📊 Current Database State:
   Alerts: 19,406 unique transactions
   Events: 19 unique transaction records

🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED!
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### No Action Required!
The system automatically handles duplicates now. Just use it normally:

```javascript
// Your existing code works exactly the same
// But duplicates are now automatically prevented

await insertAlert({ txHash: '0xabc123', ... });  // ✅ Inserted
await insertAlert({ txHash: '0xabc123', ... });  // ⚠️ Skipped (duplicate)

await logEvent({ txHash: '0xabc123', eventType: 'simulation', ... });  // ✅ Logged
await logEvent({ txHash: '0xabc123', eventType: 'simulation', ... });  // ⚠️ Skipped
await logEvent({ txHash: '0xabc123', eventType: 'protection', ... });  // ✅ Logged (different type)
```

## 📊 What You'll See

### Console Logs
When duplicates are detected, you'll see friendly messages:
```
📊 Logged event: simulation - success (risk: HIGH)
📊 Duplicate event skipped: 0xabc123 - simulation
```

### Dashboard Analytics
- **Before**: Inflated numbers due to duplicates
- **After**: Accurate, unique transaction counts ✅

### Database
- Each `tx_hash` appears only once in `alerts` table
- Each `(tx_hash, event_type)` appears only once in `events_log` table

---

## 🧪 Test It Yourself (Optional)

Run the test script anytime:
```bash
cd backend
node test-unique-transactions.js
```

You should see:
```
🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED! Unique transactions implementation is working correctly!
```

## 📂 What Was Changed

### Database Schema
- `alerts` table: Added `UNIQUE (tx_hash)` constraint
- `events_log` table: Added `UNIQUE (tx_hash, event_type)` constraint

### Code Files
- `backend/utils/db.js`: Updated `insertAlert()` and `logEvent()`
- `backend/src/db/alerts.js`: Updated `insertAlertWithSim()`

### Migration Files
- `backend/scripts/add-unique-constraints.sql`: SQL migration
- `backend/scripts/run-unique-constraints.js`: Migration runner
- `backend/test-unique-transactions.js`: Test script

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your analytics are now **100% accurate** with unique transactions only. The system automatically prevents duplicates, so you don't need to change anything in your workflow.
