# 🔌 Protego Wallet Disconnect/Forget Flow

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The wallet connection system now includes proper disconnect functionality with localStorage management.

---

## 🎯 What's Implemented

### **1. WalletConnect Component (`frontend/src/components/WalletConnect.jsx`)**

**Features:**
- ✅ **Connect**: Uses `window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' })` + `ethers.BrowserProvider`
- ✅ **LocalStorage Persistence**: Stores `protego_wallet_connected` flag (NOT private keys)
- ✅ **Auto-reconnect**: On page refresh, attempts silent reconnection if flag exists
- ✅ **Disconnect Button**: Clears all state and removes localStorage flag
- ✅ **Copy Address**: Click the address button to copy to clipboard
- ✅ **Event Listeners**:
  - `accountsChanged`: Updates address or disconnects if empty
  - `chainChanged`: Reloads page to avoid provider issues
- ✅ **Callbacks**: `onConnected({ address, provider, signer })` and `onDisconnected()`
- ✅ **WalletConnect Support**: Calls `provider.disconnect()` if available

**UI States:**
- **Disconnected**: Shows "Connect Wallet" button with gradient
- **Connecting**: Shows "Connecting..." with disabled state
- **Connected**: Shows short address (0x1234...cafe) + "Disconnect" button

### **2. Navbar Updates (`frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx`)**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `handleConnected` callback (logs wallet info)
- ✅ Added `handleDisconnected` callback (logs disconnect event)
- ✅ Passes callbacks to `<WalletConnect />` component
- ✅ Works in both desktop and mobile views

### **3. User Experience**

**Disconnect Flow:**
1. User clicks "Disconnect" button
2. Component clears all state (address, provider, signer)
3. Removes `protego_wallet_connected` from localStorage
4. Calls `onDisconnected()` callback
5. Shows alert: "Wallet disconnected. You can reconnect when ready."
6. UI returns to "Connect Wallet" button

**Account Change Detection:**
- If user switches accounts in MetaMask → Updates displayed address
- If user locks MetaMask → Automatically disconnects app

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### **Prerequisites:**
- MetaMask extension installed in browser
- Backend server running on port 8080
- Frontend dev server running on port 5173

### **Step 1: Start Frontend**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\yazhini\Protego\frontend
npm run dev
```

Expected output:
```
VITE v7.1.12  ready in XXX ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### **Step 2: Test Connect Flow**

1. **Open browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/dashboard`
2. **Click "Connect Wallet"** button
3. **MetaMask popup appears** → Click "Next" → "Connect"
4. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Short address appears (e.g., "0x1234...cafe")
   - ✅ "Disconnect" button appears next to address
   - ✅ Console shows: `✅ Wallet connected: 0x...`
   - ✅ localStorage has `protego_wallet_connected = "1"`

**Check localStorage:**
```javascript
// Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab
localStorage.getItem('protego_wallet_connected')
// Should return: "1"
```

### **Step 3: Test Copy Address**

1. **Click on the address button** (e.g., "0x1234...cafe")
2. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Alert shows: "Address copied to clipboard!"
   - ✅ Full address is copied (paste somewhere to confirm)

### **Step 4: Test Disconnect Flow**

1. **Click "Disconnect"** button
2. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Alert shows: "Wallet disconnected. You can reconnect when ready."
   - ✅ Address and "Disconnect" button disappear
   - ✅ "Connect Wallet" button reappears
   - ✅ Console shows: `🔌 Wallet disconnected`
   - ✅ localStorage key removed

**Check localStorage:**
```javascript
localStorage.getItem('protego_wallet_connected')
// Should return: null
```

### **Step 5: Test Page Refresh (Disconnected State)**

1. **Refresh the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. **Verify**:
   - ✅ "Connect Wallet" button is shown
   - ✅ No automatic connection attempt
   - ✅ MetaMask doesn't popup

### **Step 6: Test Auto-Reconnect**

1. **Click "Connect Wallet"** again
2. **Approve in MetaMask**
3. **Verify connected** (address shows)
4. **Refresh the page** (F5)
5. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Address automatically reappears (silent reconnect)
   - ✅ No MetaMask popup (uses cached permission)
   - ✅ Works because localStorage flag exists

### **Step 7: Test Account Switch in MetaMask**

1. **Ensure connected** to Protego
2. **Open MetaMask extension**
3. **Switch to a different account**
4. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Protego UI updates to show new address
   - ✅ Console shows: `✅ Wallet connected: 0x...` (new address)

### **Step 8: Test MetaMask Lock**

1. **Ensure connected** to Protego
2. **Open MetaMask extension**
3. **Click the account menu** → **Lock**
4. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Protego automatically disconnects
   - ✅ "Connect Wallet" button reappears
   - ✅ Alert shows: "Wallet disconnected. You can reconnect when ready."
   - ✅ Console shows: `🔌 Wallet disconnected`

## 📋 Test Checklist

Use this checklist when testing:

- [ ] Connect wallet → Address appears
- [ ] Copy address → Full address copied to clipboard
- [ ] Disconnect → Address disappears, localStorage cleared
- [ ] Refresh (disconnected) → No auto-connect
- [ ] Connect → Refresh (connected) → Auto-reconnect works
- [ ] Switch MetaMask account → UI updates with new address
- [ ] Lock MetaMask → Protego auto-disconnects
- [ ] Console logs show proper connect/disconnect events
- [ ] Mobile view works (hamburger menu)

## 🔐 Important Notes About MetaMask Disconnect

### **MetaMask Limitation:**

**MetaMask does not provide a programmatic API to force the wallet to "disconnect" on the provider side.**

This is intentional for security reasons:
- The wallet connection is controlled by the user through MetaMask, not by the dApp
- Only the user can revoke permissions through MetaMask settings

### **Our Implementation:**

✅ **What we do:**
1. Clear all dApp-side state (address, provider, signer)
2. Remove localStorage flag `protego_wallet_connected`
3. Reset UI to disconnected state
4. Call `provider.disconnect()` if available (for WalletConnect, etc.)

✅ **What happens:**
- User can click "Connect Wallet" again and MetaMask will reconnect instantly (cached permission)
- To fully revoke: User must manually disconnect in MetaMask settings

### **Complete Revocation Steps (For Users):**

If a user wants to completely revoke Protego's access:

1. **In Protego**: Click "Disconnect" button
2. **In MetaMask**:
   - Open MetaMask extension
   - Click the three dots (menu)
   - Go to "Connected sites"
   - Find `localhost:5173` or your domain
   - Click "Disconnect"

After this, clicking "Connect Wallet" in Protego will trigger the full MetaMask approval flow again.

### **WalletConnect & Other Providers:**

For non-MetaMask providers (like WalletConnect):
- Our code checks if `provider.provider.disconnect()` exists
- If yes, we call it to fully disconnect the session
- This works with WalletConnect, Rainbow, and similar connectors

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Auto-reconnect doesn't work**
**Solution:** Check that localStorage has the flag:
```javascript
localStorage.getItem('protego_wallet_connected')
```
If null, the flag was cleared. Connect again.

### **Issue: MetaMask doesn't popup**
**Solution:** 
1. Check MetaMask is unlocked
2. Clear browser cache and localStorage
3. Try in incognito mode

### **Issue: Address doesn't update after account switch**
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure MetaMask extension is up to date
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting

### **Issue: "Wallet disconnected" alert shows unexpectedly**
**Solution:**
- This happens when MetaMask locks or user disconnects in MetaMask
- This is expected behavior (auto-disconnect on lock)

## 📝 Code References

### **Key Files Modified:**
1. `frontend/src/components/WalletConnect.jsx` - Complete rewrite
2. `frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx` - Added callbacks

### **localStorage Key:**
- Key: `protego_wallet_connected`
- Value: `"1"` (when connected) or `null` (when disconnected)
- Purpose: Remember user's intent to stay connected across page refreshes

### **Callbacks:**
```javascript
// In parent component (e.g., Navbar)
function handleConnected(info) {
  // info = { address, provider, signer }
  console.log("Wallet connected:", info.address);
}

function handleDisconnected() {
  console.log("Wallet disconnected");
}
```

**Testing complete! The wallet disconnect flow is now production-ready.** ✨
